```html
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-lg bg-blue-500">
  <!-- Your content here -->
</div>
```
This improved code adds `bg-blue-500` as a fallback background color.  This ensures that even if the gradient fails to render, a solid blue background will be displayed, preventing a completely blank or unexpectedly colored background.
