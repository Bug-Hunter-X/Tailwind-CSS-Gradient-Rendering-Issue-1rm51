This code snippet uses Tailwind CSS gradient classes. However, if the browser doesn't support the `linear-gradient` property or if there's a conflict with other CSS rules, the gradient might not render correctly.  This can lead to unexpected visual issues where the background appears solid or incorrectly colored.
