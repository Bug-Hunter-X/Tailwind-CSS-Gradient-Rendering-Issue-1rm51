# Tailwind CSS Gradient Rendering Bug

This repository demonstrates a potential issue with Tailwind CSS gradients and provides a solution.

## Bug Description
Tailwind's gradient utilities are convenient, but they can fail to render correctly under certain circumstances (browser incompatibility, CSS conflicts).  This can result in a solid color background instead of the expected gradient.

## Solution
The solution involves using fallback colors and ensuring that the Tailwind CSS classes are applied correctly, avoiding conflicts with other styles.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `bug.html` to see the buggy behavior.
3. Open `bugSolution.html` to see the corrected code.
